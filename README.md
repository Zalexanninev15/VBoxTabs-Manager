## Description

**VBoxTabs Manager** is a application that allows you to gather all running VirtualBox virtual machines into a single window with tabs. All elements and functionality of VirtualBox windows are fully preserved.

## Features

-   **Automatic Detection**: Finds running VirtualBox virtual machines automatically.
-   **Tabbed Interface**: Combines VM windows into tabs with easy switching.
-   **Full VM Functionality**: Preserves the complete functionality of the original VirtualBox window within the tab.
-   **Tab Management**:
    -   Rename tabs for better identification.
    -   Detach VMs back into separate windows using the toolbar or context menu.
    -   Reorder tabs using drag and drop.
    -   Forcefully close a VM window using the toolbar, context menu, or middle mouse click on the tab.
-   **Toolbar Actions**: Quick access buttons for:
    -   Refreshing the VM list.
    -   Attaching all available VMs.
    -   Detaching the current VM.
    -   Force closing the current VM window.
    -   Renaming the current tab.
    -   Opening the main VirtualBox application.
-   **Theme Selection**: Choose from various built-in Qt themes and themes provided by `qdarkstyle` and `qt-themes`.
-   **Context Menu**: Right-click a tab for quick actions (rename, detach, close). Hold **Ctrl** while right-clicking to interact with an inactive tab's menu without switching to it.
-   **Automatic Refresh**: Periodically checks for new or closed VM windows.
-   **Multilingual Title Support**: Recognizes both English "[Running]" and Russian "[Ð Ð°Ð±Ð¾Ñ‚Ð°ÐµÑ‚]" in window titles.
-   **Clean Exit**: Automatically detaches all VMs when the application is closed.

## Requirements

- OS: Windows 10/11
- VirtualBox 7.0 or higher (It also works with earlier versions 5 and 6)
- No dependencies required for the standalone build (see below for running from source)

## Roadmap (I will be very glad of your help)

- [ ] Linux support.
- [ ] Settings and their saving (window detection time, selected theme, scale and others...)
- [ ] Disable the automatic attach of windows to tabs (the function will be enabled by default, because all windows with Oracle VirtualBox are attached, even if there is this text in the title of the browser window, It is required to first implement 2 roadmap point). Also, the lack of this option currently breaks the logic of the window detach function.
- [ ] Quickly force-close (yes, it is closing) all windows that work as tabs.
- [ ] View some information about running virtual machines. The information will be collected directly from the VirtualBox console implementation, most likely it will be.
- [ ] Support for multiple windows in one tab with different layout.
- [ ] Viewing a preview of the selected window when hovering over the tab.
- [ ] If possible, improve the method of building an executable file for Windows. It's not really important, but it would be great.
- [ ] If there are problems, fix the display on screens with high resolution and a scale above 100%.

## Installation and Usage

### 1. Using the Release (Recommended)

- Download the latest ready-to-use EXE in archive (because the dependency files are already archived) from the [releases page](https://github.com/Zalexanninev15/VBoxTabs-Manager/releases/latest).
- Run `VBoxTabsManager.exe` â€” **no installation and no dependencies are required in the system**.

### 2. Running from Source

1. Install Python 3.13+ (maybe, 3.8+).
2. Install dependencies:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    ðŸŒˆ [test] If you want more themes available, you can additionally install *qt-themes*:

    ```shell
    pip install qt-themes
    ```

3. Download or clone this repository.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Zalexanninev15/VBoxTabs-Manager
    ```

4. Start the required virtual machines in VirtualBox.
5. Run the application:

    ```batch
    python ./VBoxTabs-Manager.py
    ```

All detected running virtual machines will be added to the tabs.

### Actions

-   **Switch between VMs**: Click the corresponding tab.
-   **Reorder Tabs**: Drag and drop tabs within the tab bar.
-   **Detach a VM**: Click the "Detach current VM" button in the toolbar, or right-click the tab and select "Detach".
-   **Attach all available VMs**: Click the "Attach all available VMs" button in the toolbar.
-   **Refresh VM List**: Click the "Refresh VM list" button in the toolbar (also runs automatically).
-   **Rename a Tab**: Select the tab, click the "Rename current tab" button in the toolbar, or right-click the tab and select "Rename".
-   **Force Close VM Window**: Select the tab, click the "Close current VM window" button, middle-click the tab, or right-click the tab and select "Close window". *Warning: This terminates the VM process without graceful shutdown.*
-   **Open VirtualBox Manager**: Click the "Open VirtualBox main application" button in the toolbar.
-   **Change Theme**: Select a theme from the "Theme:" dropdown menu in the toolbar.
-   **Context Menu**: Right-click any tab for quick actions (Rename, Detach, Close Window). Hold **Ctrl** while right-clicking to open the menu for an inactive tab without switching to it.

When closing the application, all virtual machines are automatically detached back to separate windows.

## Troubleshooting

- **Virtual machine is not detected**: make sure the virtual machine is running and has "[Running]" or "[Ð Ð°Ð±Ð¾Ñ‚Ð°ÐµÑ‚]" in the title.
- **Problems displaying window content**: try resizing the main application window.

## Building EXE (with files)

A GitHub Action is provided to automatically build a Windows x64 executable file with other files (no dependencies required) on every commit that changes `VBoxTabs-Manager.py`. The resulting build is published as a release with the version taken from the application.

Use the `build.cmd` script to create executable file with other files.
